# EudaimoniaGo: Complete Logical Flow

## Four-Level Game Architecture

EudaimoniaGo consists of four nested games corresponding to the philosophical roles in Plato's ideal city:

1. **Categorization Game** (Philosopher Level)
   - Organizing the taxonomy of arts, zones, and experiences
   - Setting principles and virtues for the campus
   - Defining measurement criteria for happiness

2. **Connection Game** (Statesman Level)
   - Linking zones in optimal resource networks
   - Establishing governance relationships
   - Measuring and improving overall happiness metrics

3. **Zone Management Game** (Sophist Level)
   - Running individual zones effectively
   - Leading zone members in activities
   - Implementing decisions from higher levels

4. **Arts Practice Game** (Craftsman Level)
   - Executing specific arts and skills
   - Creating artifacts and value
   - Participating in experiences

Each level contains and depends on those below it, creating a fully integrated system.

## I. USER JOURNEY LOGIC

### Initial Onboarding

```
IF user downloads and opens app for first time
THEN
    Create User record
    Perform initial virtue assessment
    Create VirtueMetrics record with baseline values
    Initialize ResourceInventory with starter resources
    Assign to Port economic layer
    
    IF user completes tutorial
    THEN
        Unlock first 3 starter Arts in their collection
        Assign to nearest active Zone
        Create first AI-recommended UserGoal
        Direct to Main Map screen
    ELSE
        Prompt to complete tutorial
    END IF
END IF
```

### Art Collection

```
IF user encounters uncaptured Art on map
THEN
    Display Art information preview
    
    IF user initiates capture process
    THEN
        Launch capture mini-game/challenge
        
        IF user successfully completes challenge
        THEN
            Create ArtMastery record for user
            Link Art to user's collection
            Update TechTree to show newly available connections
            Award capture achievements if applicable
            Update VirtueMetrics based on art virtueContributions
            
            IF art is first of its taxonomy category
            THEN
                Unlock related Experience opportunities
                Create AI recommendation to explore this art category
            END IF
        ELSE
            Allow retry or exit
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Art Mastery Progression

```
IF user selects Art in their collection to practice
THEN
    Display five parts of the Art
    Show current mastery levels for each part
    Present available practice Experiences
    
    IF user selects an Art practice Experience
    THEN
        Create ExperienceInstance record
        Guide user through practice stages
        
        FOR EACH stage in ArtStage
        DO
            Present stage instructions and requirements
            Track user's progress
            
            IF stage requires verification
            THEN
                Collect submission (text, photo, etc.)
                Verify completion through AI or peer review
            END IF
            
            IF stage completed successfully
            THEN
                Update UserArtStageProgress
                Increase mastery for relevant part
                
                IF all stages completed
                THEN
                    Increase overall ArtMastery level
                    Update VirtueMetrics based on mastery gain
                    Potentially unlock dependent Arts in TechTree
                    Create artifact if applicable
                END IF
            END IF
        END
    END IF
END IF
```

### Experience Participation

```

    Display filtered list based on:
        - User's art mastery
        - Current zone
        - User's rank
        - Previous completions
    
    IF user selects Experience
    THEN
        Show details and requirements
        Display potential rewards and virtue impacts
        
        IF user meets requirements AND chooses to participate
        THEN
            IF experience is solo
            THEN
                Create ExperienceInstance immediately
            ELSE IF experience requires multiple participants
            THEN
                Create ExperienceInstance in "Scheduled" status
                Allow inviting other users or wait for joining
                
                IF minimum participants joined
                THEN
                    Update status to "Ready"
                END IF
            END IF
            
            WHEN ExperienceInstance is ready
            THEN
                Guide user through matrix flow phases:
                    1. Soul Out (planning)
                    2. Body Out (execution)
                    3. Soul In (review)
                    4. Body In (resource exchange)
                
                FOR EACH phase
                DO
                    Present phase-specific instructions
                    Collect required inputs or actions
                    Verify completion
                    
                    IF phase completed
                    THEN
                        Update ExperienceInstance.phaseProgress
                        Proceed to next phase
                    END IF
                END
                
                IF all phases completed
                THEN
                    Create Artifact(s) if applicable

                END IF
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### AI Guide Interaction

```
IF user accesses AI Guide
THEN
    Analyze current VirtueMetrics
    Identify lowest virtue scores
    Review recent user activity
    
    IF specific virtue deficiency detected
    THEN
        Create HappinessRecommendation targeting that virtue
        Suggest Arts that would improve the virtue
        Recommend Experiences that utilize those Arts
        
        IF user accepts recommendation
        THEN
            Create UserGoal based on recommendation
            Add recommended Experiences to user's suggested list
            Schedule follow-up check on progress
        END IF
    END IF
    
    IF user asks specific question
    THEN
        Record in AiInteraction
        Generate contextual response
        Offer actionable next steps
    END IF
END IF
```

### Rank Progression

```
IF system performs regular user rank evaluation
THEN
    Calculate overall happiness score from VirtueMetrics
    Review Art mastery breadth and depth
    Assess zone contributions
    
    IF user meets criteria for next rank
    THEN
        Update User.rank
        Unlock new privileges:
            - Access to higher-tier Arts
            - Advanced zone responsibilities
            - New economic opportunities

        IF rank reaches threshold for Laws economic layer
        THEN
            Enable transition from Port to Laws model
            Create WealthClass record for user
        ELSE IF rank reaches threshold for Republic model
        THEN
            Enable access to CommonResource system
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

## II. ZONE IMPROVEMENT MECHANISMS

### Zone Activity Cycle

```
IF zone is active
THEN
    Current matrix phase determines available activities:
    
    IF zone.currentMatrixQuadrant is "SoulOut"
    THEN
        Enable Think Tank activities
        Focus on planning and innovation
        Generate Ideas and Projects
        
    ELSE IF zone.currentMatrixQuadrant is "BodyOut"
    THEN
        Enable Production Tank activities
        Focus on creation and implementation
        Convert Ideas into Artifacts

        Focus on evaluation and governance
        Assess quality of Artifacts
        
    ELSE IF zone.currentMatrixQuadrant is "BodyIn"
    THEN
        Enable Resource Exchange activities
        Focus on acquiring and distributing resources
        Prepare for next cycle
    END IF
    
    AFTER predetermined time period
    THEN
        Rotate to next matrix quadrant
    END IF
END IF
```

### Zone Deficiency Detection

```
IF system performs zone health check
THEN
    Analyze zone metrics:
        - Productivity
        - Resource levels
        - Member happiness
        - Artifact quality
    
    IF metrics fall below thresholds
    THEN
        Create ZoneDeficiency record
        Classify deficiency type
        Calculate impact severity
        
        IF parent zone exists in ZoneHierarchy
        THEN
            Notify parent zone governance
            Trigger oversight protocol
        END IF
        
        IF deficiency relates to specific Art
        THEN
            Create HappinessRecommendations for zone members
            Suggest ArtProposals to address gap
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Zone Raid Process

```
IF team initiates Zone Raid against controlling team
THEN
    Create ZoneRaid record
    Set challenge type and parameters
    
    IF zone accepts challenge
    THEN
        Schedule raid event
        Notify all participants
        
        WHEN raid occurs
        THEN
            Teams compete in specified challenge:
                - Art mastery demonstrations
                - Resource efficiency contests
                - Artifact creation competitions
                - Innovation challenges
            
            IF challenging team wins
            THEN
                Update Zone.controllingTeam
                Transfer zone governance rights
                Award raid victory achievements
                Potentially alter zone specialization
            ELSE
                Strengthen defending team's control
                Award successful defense achievements
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Zone Hierarchy Management

```
IF monthly zone governance cycle occurs
THEN
    FOR each Sector
    DO
        Identify next zone in rotation sequence
        
        FOR each ZoneHierarchy relationship
        DO
            IF rotationSchedule indicates change
            THEN
                Update parentZoneId to new governing zone
                Transfer oversight authorities
                Notify all affected zones
            END IF
        END
    END
END IF
```

### Resource Flow Management

```
IF zone requires resources
THEN
    Check existing ResourceFlow records
    
    IF established flow exists
    THEN
        Process scheduled transfers
        Update ResourceInventory for both zones
    ELSE
        Check ZoneHierarchy for parent zone
        
        IF constitutional authority exists
        THEN
            Request resource allocation from parent
            
            IF approved
            THEN
                Create new ResourceFlow record
                Schedule regular transfers
            END IF
        ELSE
            Create market request in MarketListing
            Seek trading partners
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

## III. ART MASTERY PROGRESSION

### Art Taxonomy Development

```
IF user with Philosopher meta-role identifies missing art category
THEN
    Create ArtProposal for new taxonomy
    
    IF approved through review process
    THEN
        Create new ArtTaxonomy record
        Link existing Arts if applicable
        
        IF genus-level taxonomy
        THEN
            Create placeholder for species-level categories
            Assign to appropriate sector
        ELSE IF species-level taxonomy
        THEN
            Link to parent genus
            Define standard five parts template
        ELSE IF instance-level taxonomy
        THEN
            Link to parent species
            Define specific implementation details
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Art Creation Process

```
IF user identifies need for new Art
THEN
    Check if Art already exists in taxonomy
    
    IF no existing Art addresses need
    THEN
        Create ArtProposal
        Define all five parts
        Assign to appropriate taxonomy
        Submit for review
        
        IF proposal approved
        THEN
            Create new Art record
            Add to TechTree
            Make available for discovery/capture
            Award art creation achievement
            
            IF art addresses existing ZoneDeficiency
            THEN
                Link art to deficiency
                Notify affected zones
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Composite Art Mastery

```
IF user attempts to master composite Art
THEN
    Check if user has mastered required component Arts
    
    IF any required Arts not yet mastered
    THEN
        Recommend mastering prerequisites first
        Create UserGoals for prerequisites
    ELSE
        Allow composite Art mastery progression
        Apply special bonuses for having prerequisites
        
        IF user achieves mastery
        THEN
            Apply greater virtue contributions
            Potentially unlock higher-tier composite Arts
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Collaborative Art Practice

```
IF Experience requires multiple Arts from different users
THEN
    List required Art combinations
    Allow users to join with complementary Arts
    
    IF all required Art positions filled
    THEN
        Begin collaborative Experience
        Track individual contributions
        
        IF experience completed successfully
        THEN
            Increase ArtMastery for each participant
            Create shared Artifact
            Establish SocialConnection between participants
            
            IF first time collaboration of these Arts
            THEN
                Record new effective combination
                Potentially suggest new composite Art
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Innovation Process Application

```
IF user initiates new innovation
THEN
    Create InnovationProcess record
    Set current stage to "Order"
    
    FOR EACH stage in Vitruvian cycle
    DO
        Present stage-specific requirements
        
        IF stage is "Order"
        THEN
            Require identifying all components
            Establish metrics for success
            
        ELSE IF stage is "Arrangement"
        THEN

            Use both reflection and inspiration
            
        ELSE IF stage is "Eurythmy"
        THEN
            Optimize proportions of components
            Ensure balanced relationships
            
        ELSE IF stage is "Symmetry"
        THEN
            Establish standard units
            Create consistent ratios
            
        ELSE IF stage is "Propriety"
        THEN
            Validate against established principles
            Consider traditional practices
            
        ELSE IF stage is "Economy"
        THEN
            Plan resource allocation
            Balance cost and utility
        END IF
        
        IF stage completed successfully
        THEN
            Update InnovationProcess.stageProgress
            Advance to next stage
            
            IF all stages complete
            THEN
                Create new Artifact
                Consider for new Art proposal
                Update zone innovation metrics
            END IF
        END IF
    END
END IF
```

## IV. ECONOMIC SYSTEM TRANSITIONS

### Port City Economy (External Layer)

```
IF user operates in Port economic layer
THEN
    Allow creating MarketListing with real currency
    Enable purchasing resources, services, and experiences
    Apply standard market pricing
    
    IF user creates listing
    THEN
        Create MarketListing record
        Make visible to external buyers
        
        IF purchase occurs
        THEN
            Create EconomicTransaction record
            Transfer resources or access rights
            Update seller's ResourceInventory
            Calculate platform fee
            
            IF purchase relates to project funding
            THEN
                Update Project.currentFunding
                If funding goal reached, change status to "InProgress"
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
END IF
```

### Laws Model Transition

```
IF user qualifies for Laws economic model
THEN
    Assign WealthClass based on contributions and virtues
    Grant zone allocation based on wealth class
    Set resource limits and responsibilities
    
    IF user is WealthClass 1 (highest)
    THEN
        Allow leadership in multiple zones
        Grant oversight authorities
        Require greater civic responsibilities
        
    ELSE IF user is WealthClass 2
    THEN
        Allow zone leadership
        Grant moderate resource access
        Assign specialized responsibilities
        
    ELSE IF user is WealthClass 3
    THEN
        Grant zone membership
        Assign production responsibilities
        Provide standard resource access
        
    ELSE IF user is WealthClass 4
    THEN
        Provide basic zone access
        Assign support responsibilities
        Limit resource accumulation
    END IF
    
    FOR each resource transaction
    DO
        Check against wealth class limits
        Apply progressive taxation if applicable
        Record in EconomicTransaction
    END
END IF
```

### Republic Model Implementation

```
IF user qualifies for Republic economic model
THEN
    Grant access to CommonResource system
    Remove individual ownership restrictions
    Base access on virtue metrics and contributions
    
    IF user requests resource access
    THEN
        Check user's virtue qualifications
        Verify legitimate need
        
        IF qualified
        THEN
            Grant access to CommonResource
            Record usage
            Require contribution after use
            
            IF resource supply diminishes
            THEN
                Call for replenishment contributions
                Prioritize access based on virtue ranking
            END IF
        END IF
    END IF
    
    IF governance decision required
    THEN
        Hold vote among Republic model users
        Weight votes by wisdom virtue score
        Implement decision based on vote outcome
    END IF
END IF
```

### Cross-Layer Interactions

```
IF campus requires mixed-economy project
THEN
    Create Project record
    Allow funding from Port layer
    Assign management from Laws layer
    Allocate key resources from Republic layer
    
    FOR EACH economic layer
    DO
        Apply appropriate incentive structure:
            - Port: Financial returns
            - Laws: Status and authority
            - Republic: Virtue recognition
        
        Track contributions by layer
        
        IF project succeeds
        THEN
            Distribute benefits across layers:
                - Port: Financial returns

## VI. INTERCONNECTION & EMERGENCE

### Self-Improving System Cycles

```
IF campus operates over time
THEN
    Craftsmen create artifacts through arts
    Sophists coordinate zone activities
    Statesmen connect zones and resources
    Philosophers categorize and measure
    
    FOR EACH discovered deficiency
    DO
        Philosophers define the problem
        Statesmen allocate resources to solve it
        Sophists organize teams to implement solutions
        Craftsmen execute the required arts
        
        IF problem solved successfully
        THEN
            Campus-wide happiness increases
            New innovations emerge
            Art taxonomy expands
            Zone capabilities grow
            
            IF repeated consistently
            THEN
                Virtuous cycle accelerates
                Campus evolves toward higher functioning
                Eudaimonia increases for all participants
            END IF
        END IF
    END
END IF
```

This logical flow document outlines how the various components of EudaimoniaGo interact to create a holistic, self-improving system that naturally guides users toward building a better campus while improving their own happiness through virtue development.
